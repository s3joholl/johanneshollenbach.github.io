    <p style="margin: 0" align="justify"><small>German hospitals largely rely on public investments for digitization. As
            these have been insufficient, hospitals had to use own profits to foster digital transformation. Thus, we
            assess if profitability affects digital maturity, and what other factors might be influential. We use
            digital maturity data from the DigitalRadar (DR) project (2021) and financial statement data from the
            Hospital Rating Report from 2017 to 2019 (n = 860). We run linear regressions with the DR-score (continuous
            variable from 0 to 100) as dependent and three-year average EBITDA margin as independent variable. Besides,
            we conduct subgroup analyses stratifying by chain size. A one percentage point EBITDA margin increase is
            associated with a 0.359 points DR-score increase (p<0.01). This relationship holds in significance and holds
                or increases in magnitude for all specifications except when adding chain beds (0.212 point DR-score
                increase, p<0.05). Besides, chain membership and chain size are positively and significantly associated
                with hospitals’ DR-score. EBITDA margins of the subgroups “large chains” and “Big 3”, i.e., the three
                largest chains, were strongly associated with the DR-score (2.685 and 3.197 points DR-score increase
                respectively, p<0.01). Higher profitability is associated with higher digital maturity. Larger chains
                are digitally more mature, because (1) they might follow a chain-wide IT-strategy, (2) can standardize
                IT-architecture, and policies and (3) might cross-finance investments.</small>

    <p style="margin: 0" align="justify"><small>We study the short- and long-term effects of retirement on loneliness
            using panel data from the Survey of Health, Aging, and Retirement in Europe. To estimate causal effects, we
            exploit differences in retirement eligibility rules across and within countries in an instrumental variable
            setting. While we find no clear effect in the short run, entry into retirement reduces loneliness several
            years later. This reduction is driven by individuals being less likely to feel socially isolated and lacking
            companionship. Our results suggest that individuals adapt to retirement by increasing their activity levels
            and reap the benefits in terms of reduced loneliness and social isolation. Heterogeneity analysis by gender
            shows that retirement increases feelings of loneliness for women in the short term and that this effect
            appears to be driven by women lacking companionship when their partner is not yet retired.</small></p>
