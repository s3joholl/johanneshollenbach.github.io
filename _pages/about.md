Hi! I'm Johannes, a researcher at <a href="https://www.rwi-essen.de/" target="_blank">RWI - Leibniz-Institute for Economic Research</a> in Essen, Germany and an economics PhD student at the University of Paderborn (advisor: <a href="https://wiwi.uni-paderborn.de/en/wiwiunipaderborndewipo/empwifo/team/prof-dr-hendrik-schmitz/" target="_blank">Hendrik Schmitz</a>).

My research interests are in applied econometrics and policy analysis, particularly at the intersection of education and health, and the relationship between environmental factors, such as pollution, and health.

As part of my work in policy consulting at RWI, I'm part of a team evaluating a federal law aimed at improving the digitalization of German hospitals. I have also co-authored several Hospital and Nursing Home Rating Reports (in German), which provide an overview of the economic situation of hospitals and nursing homes in Germany.
