Hi! I'm Johannes, a researcher at <a href="https://www.rwi-essen.de/" target="_blank">RWI - Leibniz-Institute for Economic Research</a> in Essen, Germany and an economics PhD student at the University of Paderborn (advisor: <a href="https://wiwi.uni-paderborn.de/en/wiwiunipaderborndewipo/empwifo/team/prof-dr-hendrik-schmitz/" target="_blank">Hendrik Schmitz</a>)

My research interests are in applied econometrics and policy analysis, particularly at the intersections of health and education/environment as well as human capital formation.
