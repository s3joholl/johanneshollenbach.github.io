Hi! I'm Johannes, a Ph.D. candidate in Economics and research assistant at Paderborn University and RWI - Leibniz-Institute for Economic Research. 

My research areas include applied econometrics, health and education economics. I'm particularly interested in how policy interventions can reduce inequalities and support human capital development.

As part of my work in policy consulting at RWI, I have also written about health policy, especially the digitalization and the economic situation of hospitals.

Hi! I'm Johannes, a researcher at RWI - Leibniz-Institute for Economic Research in Essen, Germany and an economics PhD student at the University of Paderborn (advisor: <a href="https://www.uni-paderborn.de/en/person/48879/" target="_blank">Hendrik Schmitz</a>).

My areas of research include health and education economics as well as social genomics. I'm particularly interested in how policy interventions can improve health, reduce inequalities and support human capital development.

As part of my work in policy consulting at RWI, I have also written about hospital digitalization and co-authored several Hospital and Nursing Home Rating Reports (in German).

, which provide an overview of the economic situation of hospitals and nursing homes in Germany.
