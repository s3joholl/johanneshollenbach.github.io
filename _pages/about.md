Hi! I'm Johannes, a researcher at <a href="https://www.rwi-essen.de/" target="_blank">RWI - Leibniz-Institute for Economic Research</a> in Essen, Germany and an economics PhD student at the University of Paderborn (advisor: <a href="https://www.uni-paderborn.de/en/person/48879/" target="_blank">Hendrik Schmitz</a>).

My areas of research include applied econometrics, health economics and social genomics. I'm particularly interested in how policy interventions can improve health, reduce inequalities and support human capital development.

As part of my work in policy consulting at RWI, I have also written about hospital digitalization and co-authored several Hospital and Nursing Home Rating Reports (in German), which provide an overview of the economic situation of hospitals and nursing homes in Germany.
